Fix: Admin API routing and login authentication

## Problem
Admin login was returning HTML instead of JSON:
- Error: SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<', "<!doctype "... is not valid JSON
- Admin panel at /admin/ couldn't authenticate users
- API endpoint /admin/api/account/login was being caught by SPA fallback

## Root Cause
1. Admin Angular app uses baseHref="/admin/"
2. Fallback controller was catching ALL /admin/* routes (including /admin/api/*)
3. API routes had lower priority than SPA fallback
4. No dedicated admin authentication endpoint

## Solution

### 1. Created Admin AccountController
- New: API/API/Controllers/Admin/AccountController.cs
- Route: [Route("admin/api/[controller]")]
- Handles: /admin/api/account/login
- Validates user has admin/employee role before allowing login
- Supports login by username OR email

### 2. Fixed Routing Priority in Program.cs
- Removed conflicting UseDefaultFiles()
- Moved MapControllers() before fallback routes
- Added check to exclude /admin/api/* from SPA fallback
- Order now: API routes → Admin SPA → Main SPA

### 3. Login Credentials
Default admin account (from AppIdentityDbContextSeed.cs):
- Username: marki (or email: admin@marki.vn)
- Password: Pa$$w0rd
- Roles: Admin, SuperAdmin

## Testing
✅ curl -X POST /admin/api/account/login returns JSON (not HTML)
✅ Admin panel login works
✅ Non-admin users are rejected with proper message
✅ Both username and email login work

## Changes
- NEW: API/API/Controllers/Admin/AccountController.cs
- MODIFIED: API/API/Program.cs (routing order)
- DOCUMENTED: ADMIN_LOGIN_GUIDE.md

## Security Notes
⚠️ Default password "Pa$$w0rd" is for development only
⚠️ Change passwords before production deployment
⚠️ Consider implementing account lockout and password policies

Fixes routing conflict between Admin SPA and Admin API endpoints
